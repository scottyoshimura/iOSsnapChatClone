        //we want to know the "translation" of the gesture. the translation from one point to another is a description of how to get from one point to another. we want to know where it started, and where it ended up.
        //lets create a variable to get that. we will take our gesture that was passed from the UIPanGestureRecognizer and we can take from that the translation in the view; the view is just self.
        let translation = gesture.translationInView(self.view)
        
        //now we want to move the label too, the translation coordinate.
        //notice we can't use label here, but the gesture variable gives us the object that has been dragged, so we can get that to represent our label. we have to force unwrap gesture.view, cause we know it will be there.
        print(translation)
        let label = gesture.view!
        
        //then we will set the label.center to the new coordinate. we get that from cgpoint. cg point creates a coordinate pair relative to the bottom left of the screen. and remember translation gives us a coordinate relative to the center of the screen, which is where we started off. too work out hte new coordinate is as a cgpoint to start off in the center of the screen, and then add the amount that has been translated in the x direction.
        
        label.center = CGPoint(x: self.view.bounds.width/2 + translation.x, y: self.view.bounds.height/2 + translation.y)
        //we can set the label so that it returns to the center whenever the user lets their finger off the screen by checking another aspect of our gesture variable which is gesture.state
        
        //the more this label moves to left or right, we want it to get smaller lets set up a variable that tracks how far from the center the label is
        let xFromCenter = label.center.x - self.view.bounds.width / 2
        
        //lets set up a scale which is going to determine the size based on how far it is from the center. so we know we need xFromCenter, we don't care about scaling to the left or the right, so we use abs, which is short for absolute, which just gives you the value of xFromCenter regardless if it is positive or negative. we want the scale to be one in the center, and we want it to get smaller and smaller as the xFromCenter gets bigger and bigger. if you want something to get smaller, while something gets bigger, generally it is a good idea to divide by the thing that is getting bigger. so something like below, the scale will get smaller, as xFromCenter gets bigger. however, we want to be careful, cause when xFromCenter is small, then the scale could be flipped. so we don't ever want to make this thing bigger, only smaller. the way we can deal with that is to set the scale to a minimum of either the calculation below, or 1. so essentially, it can never be greater than 1.
        let scale = min(100 / abs(xFromCenter), 1)
        
        //below, makes a rotation based from an angle. the angle is in radians. a radian is like a degree, a deggree is split from a circle 360 degrees, with a tranform, the circle is split into two pi radians, which makes certain mathmatical tasks much easier, but make it more complicated to think about. for now, lets say about two pi is 6. so we want one radian.
        var rotation = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(xFromCenter / 200)
